int main()

    return 0;
    /* On most systems, the value returned from main is a status indicator. A return
value of 0 indicates success. A nonzero return has a meaning that is defined by the
system. Ordinarily a nonzero return indicates what kind of error occurred. 


To see the status on a Windows system, we write
win- $ echo %ERRORLEVEL%
linux- $ echo $?
